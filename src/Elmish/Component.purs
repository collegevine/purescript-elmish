-- | A UI component state transition: wraps the new state value together with a
-- | (possibly empty) list of effects that the transition has caused (called
-- | "commands"), with each command possibly producing some new messages.
-- |
-- | Instances of this type may be created either by using the smart constructor:
-- |
-- |     update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
-- |     update state m = transition state [someCommand]
-- |
-- | or in monadic style (see comments on `fork` for more on this):
-- |
-- |     update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
-- |     update state m = do
-- |         s1 <- Child1.update state.child1 Child1.SomeMessage # lmap Child1Msg
-- |         s2 <- Child2.modifyFoo state.child2 # lmap Child2Msg
-- |         fork someEffect
-- |         pure state { child1 = s1, child2 = s2 }
-- |
-- | or, for simple sub-component delegation, the `BiFunctor` instance may be
-- | used:
-- |
-- |     update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
-- |     update state (ChildMsg m) =
-- |         Child.update state.child m
-- |         # bimap ChildMsg (state { child = _ })
-- |
data Transition' m msg state = Transition state (Array (Command m msg))

-- A `Transition'` in which the effects run in `Aff`.
type Transition msg state = Transition' Aff msg state

-- | An effect that is launched as a result of a component state transition.
-- | It's a function that takes a callback, which allows it to produce (aka
-- | "dispatch") messages, as well as an `onStop` function, which allows it to
-- | install a handler to be executed whent the component is destroyed (aka
-- | "unmounted").
-- |
-- | See `forks` for a more detailed explanation.
type Command m msg = { dispatch :: Dispatch msg, onStop :: m Unit -> Effect Unit } -> m Unit

instance Functor m => Bifunctor (Transition' m) where
    bimap f g (Transition s cmds) =
      Transition (g s) (cmds <#> \cmd { dispatch, onStop } -> cmd { dispatch: dispatch <<< f, onStop })
instance Functor (Transition' m msg) where
    map f (Transition x cmds) = Transition (f x) cmds
instance Apply (Transition' m msg) where
    apply (Transition f cmds1) (Transition x cmds2) = Transition (f x) (cmds1 <> cmds2)
instance Applicative (Transition' m msg) where
    pure a = Transition a []
instance Bind (Transition' m msg) where
    bind (Transition s cmds) f =
        let (Transition s' cmds') = f s
        in Transition s' (cmds <> cmds')
instance Monad (Transition' m msg)

-- | Smart constructor for the `Transition'` type. See comments there. This
-- | function takes the new (i.e. updated) state and an array of commands - i.e.
-- | effects producing messages - and constructs a `Transition'` out of them
transition :: ∀ m state msg. Bind m => MonadEffect m => state -> Array (m msg) -> Transition' m msg state
transition s cmds =
    Transition s $ cmds <#> \cmd { dispatch } -> do
        msg <- cmd
        liftEffect $ dispatch msg

-- | Creates a `Transition'` that contains the given command (i.e. a
-- | message-producing effect). This is intended to be used for "accumulating"
-- | effects while constructing a transition in imperative-ish style. When used
-- | as an action inside a `do` block, this function will have the effect of
-- | "adding the command to the list" to be executed. The name `fork` reflects
-- | the fact that the given effect will be executed asynchronously, after the
-- | `update` function returns.
-- |
-- | In more precise terms, the following:
-- |
-- |     trs :: Transition' m Message State
-- |     trs = do
-- |         fork f
-- |         fork g
-- |         pure s
-- |
-- | Is equivalent to this:
-- |
-- |     trs :: Transition' m Message State
-- |     trs = transition s [f, g]
-- |
-- | At first glance it may seem that it's shorter to just call the `transition`
-- | smart constructor, but monadic style comes in handy for composing the
-- | update out of smaller pieces. Here's a more full example:
-- |
-- |     data Message = ButtonClicked | OnNewItem String
-- |
-- |     update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
-- |     update state ButtonClick = do
-- |         fork $ insertItem "new list"
-- |         incButtonClickCount state
-- |     update state (OnNewItem str) =
-- |         ...
-- |
-- |     insertItem :: Aff Message
-- |     insertItem name = do
-- |         delay $ Milliseconds 1000.0
-- |         pure $ OnNewItem name
-- |
-- |     incButtonClickCount :: Transition Message State
-- |     incButtonClickCount state = do
-- |         forkVoid $ trackingEvent "Button click"
-- |         pure $ state { buttonsClicked = state.buttonsClicked + 1 }
-- |
fork :: ∀ m message. MonadEffect m => m message -> Transition' m message Unit
fork cmd = transition unit [cmd]

-- | Similar to `fork` (see comments there for detailed explanation), but the
-- | parameter is a function that takes `dispatch` - a message-dispatching
-- | callback, as well as `onStop` - a way to be notified when the component is
-- | destroyed (aka "unmounted"). This structure allows the command to produce
-- | zero or multiple messages, unlike `fork`, whose callback has to produce
-- | exactly one, as well as stop listening or free resources etc. when the
-- | component is unmounted.
-- |
-- | NOTE: the `onStop` callback is not recommended for direct use, use the
-- | subscriptions API in `Elmish.Subscription` instead.
-- |
-- | Example:
-- |
-- |     update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
-- |     update state msg = do
-- |         forks countTo10
-- |         forks listenToUrl
-- |         pure state
-- |
-- |     countTo10 :: Command Aff Message
-- |     countTo10 { dispatch } =
-- |         for_ (1..10) \n ->
-- |             delay $ Milliseconds 1000.0
-- |             dispatch $ Count n
-- |
-- |     listenToUrl :: Command Aff Message
-- |     listenToUrl { dispatch, onStop } =
-- |         listener <-
-- |           window >>= addEventListener "popstate" do
-- |             newUrl <- window >>= location >>= href
-- |             dispatch $ UrlChanged newUrl
-- |
-- |         onStop $
-- |            window >>= removeEventListener listener
-- |
forks :: ∀ m message. Command m message -> Transition' m message Unit
forks cmd = Transition unit [cmd]

-- | Similar to `fork` (see comments there for detailed explanation), but the
-- | effect doesn't produce any messages, it's a fire-and-forget sort of effect.
forkVoid :: ∀ m message. m Unit -> Transition' m message Unit
forkVoid cmd = forks $ const cmd

-- | Similar to `fork` (see comments there for detailed explanation), but the
-- | effect may or may not produce a message, as modeled by returning `Maybe`.
forkMaybe :: ∀ m message. MonadEffect m => m (Maybe message) -> Transition' m message Unit
forkMaybe cmd = forks \{ dispatch } -> do
    msg <- cmd
    liftEffect $ maybe (pure unit) dispatch msg

-- | Definition of a component according to The Elm Architecture. Consists of
-- | three functions - `init`, `view`, `update`, - that together describe the
-- | lifecycle of a component.
-- |
-- | Type parameters:
-- |
-- |   * `m` - a monad in which the effects produced by `update` and `init`
-- |     functions run.
-- |   * `msg` - component's message.
-- |   * `state` - component's state.
type ComponentDef' m msg state = {
    init :: Transition' m msg state,
    view :: state -> Dispatch msg -> ReactElement,
    update :: state -> msg -> Transition' m msg state
}

-- | A `ComponentDef'` in which effects run in `Aff`.
type ComponentDef msg state = ComponentDef' Aff msg state

-- | A callback used to return multiple components of different types. See below
-- | for a more detailed explanation.
-- |
-- | This callback is handy in situations where a function must return different
-- | components (with different `state` and `message` types) depending on
-- | parameters. The prime example of such situation is routing.
-- |
-- | Because most routes are served by different UI components, with different
-- | `state` and `message` type parameters, the instantiating functions cannot
-- | have the naive signature `route -> component`: they need to "return"
-- | differently-typed results depending on the route. In order to make that
-- | happen, these functions instead take a polymorphic callback, to which they
-- | pass the UI component. This type alias is the type of such callback: it
-- | takes a polymorphically-typed UI component and returns "some value", a la
-- | continuation-passing style.
-- |
-- | Even though this type is rather trivial, it is included in the library for
-- | the purpose of attaching this documentation to it.
type ComponentReturnCallback m a =
    ∀ state msg. ComponentDef' m msg state -> a

-- | Wraps the given component, intercepts its update cycle, and traces (i.e.
-- | prints to dev console) every command and every state value (as JSON
-- | objects), plus timing of renders and state transitions.

-- | This function is low level, not intended for a use in typical consumer
-- | code. Use `construct` or `wrapWithLocalState` instead.
-- |
-- | Takes a component definition (i.e. init+view+update functions) and
-- | "renders" it as a React DOM element, suitable for passing to
-- | `ReactDOM.render` or embedding in a JSX DOM tree.

-- | Creates a React component that can be bound to a varying `ComponentDef'`,
-- | returns a function that performs the binding.
-- |
-- | Note 1: this function accepts an `Aff`-based `ComponentDef'`, it cannot
-- | take polymorphic or custom monad. The superficial reason for this is that
-- | this function is intended to be used at top-level (see explanation below),
-- | where context for a custom monad is not available. A deeper reason is that
-- | this function creates a self-contained React component, and it is precisely
-- | because it is self-contained that it cannot be seamlessly included in an
-- | outer monadic computation.
-- |
-- | This limitation forces such truly "reusable" components to be written in
-- | terms of `Aff` rather than a custom monad, which is actually a good thing.
-- | However, if it turns out that this component really needs to be in a custom
-- | monad, it is always possible to convert it to `Aff` via the `nat` function.
-- |
-- | Note 2: in order to accomplish this, such aggregated component will store
-- | its state using the React facilities - i.e. via `this.setState` and
-- | `this.state`. While this is appropriate for most cases, it actually has
-- | proven to be fragile in some specific circumstances (e.g. multiple events
-- | occurring within the same JS synchronous frame), so it is not recommended
-- | to use this mechanism for complex components or the top-level program.
wrapWithLocalState :: ∀ msg state args

wrapWithLocalState name mkDef =
    runFn2 withCachedComponent name \cmpt ->
        bindComponent cmpt localState <<< mkDef

-- | A unique name for a component created via `wrapWithLocalState`. These names
-- | don't technically need to be _completely_ unique, but they do need to be
-- | unique enough so that two different `wrapWithLocalState`-created components
-- | that happen to have the same name never replace each other in the DOM. For
-- | this reason, it is recommended to actually make sure these names are
-- | unique, for example by appending a GUID to them. Read on for a more
-- | detailed explanation.
-- |
-- | React uses referential equality to decide whether to create a new instance
-- | of a component (and thus reset its local state) or keep the existing
-- | instance. This means that, on one hand, we cannot use the same React class
-- | for every instantiation, because this may create conflicts, where one
-- | Elmish component replaces another in the DOM, but they look like the same
-- | component to React, which makes it reuse state, which leads to breaking
-- | type safety. On the other hand, we cannot create a fresh class on every
-- | render, because then React will see it as a new component every time, and
-- | will reset its state every time.
-- |
-- | This means that we need some way of figuring out whether it needs to be
-- | logically the "same" component or "different", but there is no way to get that
-- | "for free" (same way React gets it for free from referential equality) due
-- | to PureScript's purity. Therefore, the only reliable way is to ask the
-- | programmer, which is accomplished by requiring a `ComponentName`, which
-- | serves as a key.
