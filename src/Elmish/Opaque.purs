-- | An opaque reference for tunneling through JSX code.
-- |
-- | This type is a wrapper that lets us pass any PureScript values into JS
-- | code, with the expectation that the JS code cannot mess with (inspect,
-- | mutate) these values, but can pass them back to the PureScript code in
-- | messages. This type has instances of `CanPassToJavaScript` and
-- | `CanReceiveFromJavaScript`, which allows it to be passed in React props or
-- | view messages.
-- |
-- | One challenge with this type is that we can't just `unsafeCoerce` its
-- | values back and forth, because that would open a very big hole for data
-- | corruption to get in. To have some protection against it, we add a weak
-- | form of verification: internally values of `Opaque` are represented by a
-- | JavaScript hash with a sole key looking like "ref:name", whose value is the
-- | target of the ref, and where "name" is the first type argument of this
-- | `Opaque`. This way, we have at least _something_ to verify (see the
-- | `CanReceiveFromJavaScript` instance below) that the object passed by the JS
-- | code is not some random value, but actually originated as a `Opaque a` of
-- | the right type.
-- |
-- | Admittedly, this is only weak protection, because the JS code can still,
-- | if it really wanted to, construct a hash like `{ "ref:name": "abracadabra"}`
-- | and pass it to the PureScript code, which would happily
-- | accept the "abracadabra" value as if it was the right type.
-- |
-- | Here are my arguments for why this weak protection is enough:
-- |   1) The JS code has to actually _try_ to be destructive. Can't happen by
-- |      accident.
-- |   2) It's technically impossible to do any better without putting
-- |      significant restrictions on the type `a` (i.e. requiring it to be
-- |      `Generic` or to provide type name, etc.), and without losing some
-- |      performance.
-- |   3) If such corruption proves to be a problem in the future, we can always
-- |      fall back to encoding/decoding `Json`, and pay some performance for
-- |      it.
