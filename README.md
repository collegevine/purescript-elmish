# PureScript-Elmish
## A PureScript implementation of The Elm Architecture

[![build](https://github.com/collegevine/purescript-elmish/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/collegevine/purescript-elmish/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This library is an implementation of The Elm Architecture in PureScript as a
thin state-management layer on top of React, with minimal fuss and transparent
interop with React, including minimal-friction use of existing React components.

The name "Elmish" is an homage to the F# library of the same name: <https://elmish.github.io/elmish/>
