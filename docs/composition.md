# Composition
{:.no_toc}

In a real program, it is almost never enough to have all of the UI logic and
visuals in one place. Almost always it is beneficial to split up the UI into
smaller parts, usually located in separate modules, be it for clarity and
maintainability or for reuse.

This page describes different patterns of such decomposition supported by
Elmish.

## Partial view functions

The simplest way to split up a big UI is to extract some parts of its `view`
function as separate functions, what in some contexts might be called "partial
view". For example, consider the bespoke counter UI:

```haskell
type State = { count :: Int }
data Message = Inc | Dec

view :: State -> Dispatch Message -> ReactElement
view state dispatch =
  H.div ""
  [ H.div "" $ "The current count is: " <> show state.count
  , button "increase" (dispatch Inc)
  , button "decrease" (dispatch Dec)
  ]

button :: String -> Effect Unit -> ReactElement
button text onClick =
  H.div ""
  [ H.text $ "To " <> text <> " the count, click here: "
  , H.button_ "btn btn-primary" { onClick } text
  ]
```

![Counter example](counter-1.png)

Here, we have extracted the visuals for "increase" and "decrease" buttons as a
partial view function named `button`, which is then used twice in the main
`view` function.

**NOTE:** such "partial view" function doesn't have to be just a visual. As
seen in this example, it can produce messages as well.
{: .callout }

Often, especially with larger partial views, it's beneficial to name their
parameters by gathering them in a record:

```haskell
view :: State -> Dispatch Message -> ReactElement
view state dispatch =
  H.div ""
  [ H.div "" $ "The current count is: " <> show state.count
  , button { text: "increase", onClick: dispatch Inc }
  , button { text: "decrease", onClick: dispatch Dec }
  ]

button :: { text :: String, onClick :: Effect Unit } -> ReactElement
button { text, onClick } =
  H.div ""
  [ H.text $ "To " <> text <> " the count, click here: "
  , H.button_ "btn btn-primary" { onClick } text
  ]
```

## Composing full-fledged components

Partial view functions are great, because they're simple, but sometimes it does
make sense to package away a whole piece of complex UI logic - either for reuse
or just for code organization. This setup is usually referred to as "child
components".

For example, let's say we wanted to create a UI consisting of _two_ such
counters as shown above:

![Counters composed](counter-2.png)

To do this, we would aggregate the two counters' states, route their messages
and state transitions, and compose their views:

```haskell
import Counter as Counter

-- Aggregate child components' states
type State =
  { left :: Counter.State
  , right :: Counter.State
  }

-- Aggregate child components' messages
data Message
  = LeftMsg Counter.Message
  | RightMsg Counter.Message

view :: State -> Dispatch Message -> ReactElement
view state dispatch =
  H.div "row"
  [ H.div "col-6"
    [ H.h3 "" "Left counter"
    , Counter.view state.left (dispatch <<< LeftMsg)
    ]
  , H.div "col-6"
    [ H.h3 "" "Right counter"
    , Counter.view state.right (dispatch <<< RightMsg)
    ]
  ]
```

Note how we're calling `Counter.view` twice, but passing it different states
(`left` and `right`) and different `Dispatch` functions - one wrapping Counter's
messages in `LeftMsg` and the other wrapping them in `RightMsg`.

So far so good. But what about the `update` function?

Since `Transition` is a pair of state + effects
(see [Transition: Under the Hood](transition.md#under-the-hood)),
we could do it the straightforward way:

  1. Call `Counter.update`
  2. Unwrap the resulting `Transition` to obtain the new counter state and any
     effects.
  3. Plug the new counter state into the aggregate `State`
  4. Modify the effects to wrap all messages they produce in `LeftMsg` (or
     `RightMsg`).
  5. Reconstruct `Transition` out of the new aggregate `State` and the modified
     effects.

This is what your typical Elm program does, and it would look something like
this:

```haskell
update state (LeftMsg m) =
  let Transition s effs = Counter.update state.left m
      state' = state { left = s }
      effs' = map LeftMsg <$> effs
  in
    Transition state' effs'
```

This is straightforward, but in practice this becomes very tedious very fast. So
instead, we could use the fact that `Transition` is a monad (to thread the state
via `bind`) as well as a `Bifunctor` (to wrap the effect messages via `lmap`).
This would look somewhat like this:

```haskell
update state (LeftMsg m) = do
  s' <- lmap LeftMsg $ Counter.update state.left m
  pure state { left = s' }
```

**NOTE**: See the [Transition](transition.md) page for a detailed description
of how the `do` notation works with `Transition`
{: .callout }

Or even better: for a straightforward mapping like this, without any extra
processing, we could use just the `Bifunctor` aspect of `Transition` and map
both messages and state via `bimap`:

```haskell
update state (LeftMsg m) =
  bimap LeftMsg state { left = _ } $ Counter.update state.left m
```

**NOTE**: This syntax works because of how PureScript's record updates are
parsed. The expression `state { left = _ }` is a single term, equivalent to a
function `\x -> state { left = x }`
{: .callout }

Armed with this knowledge, we can now write the full `update` function of the
composed component:

```haskell
update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
update state (LeftMsg m) =
  bimap LeftMsg state { left = _ } $ Counter.update state.left m
update state (RightMsg m) =
  bimap RightMsg state { right = _ } $ Counter.update state.right m
```

This mode of composition is sure less tedious than in Elm, but still heavy
compared to the partial view functions. Use with care.

## Dedicated event loop

Aggregating child component's state and message into those of the parent
component is the standard composition procedure in The Elm Architecture.
Sometimes, however, it turns out to be very inconvenient for no reason.

Say we wanted to display two areas of our UI in "collapsible panels" - i.e. a
header with a button that shows or hides contents:

```haskell
module CollapsiblePanel where

type State = { collapsed :: Boolean }
data Message = Toggle

view :: { title :: String, content :: ReactElement } -> State -> Dispatch Message -> ReactElement
view { title, content } state dispatch =
  H.div ""
  [ H.div_ "bg-light" { onClick: dispatch Toggle } title
  , if collapsed
      then H.empty
      else H.div "" content
  ]

update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
update { collapsed } Toggle = { collapsed: not collapsed }

--------------------------------------------
module Parent where

import CollapsiblePanel as CP

type State =
  { ...
  , panel1 :: CP.State
  , panel2 :: CP.State
  }

data Message
  = ...
  | CP1Msg CP.Message
  | CP2Msg CP.Message

view :: State -> Dispatch Message -> ReactElement
view = ...
  , CP.view { title: "Panel 1", content: H.text "Content 1" } state.panel1 (dispatch <<< CP1Msg)
  ...
  , CP.view { title: "Panel 2", content: H.text "Content 2" } state.panel1 (dispatch <<< CP2Msg)
  ...

update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
...
update state (CP1Msg m) =
  CP.update state.panel1 m
  # bimap CP1Msg state { panel1 = _ }
update state (CP2Msg m) =
  CP.update state.panel2 m
  # bimap CP2Msg state { panel2 = _ }
...
```

Phew! That's a lot of boilerplate! But more importantly, the boilerplate is not
really needed here, logically speaking. We never look at any messages of the
`CollapsiblePanel`, we never inspect its state, all we do is blindly "route" the
`CollapsiblePanel`'s messages and state transitions. This is textbook accidental
complexity.

For cases like this, Elmish supports a different mode of composition -
`wrapWithLocalState`. This function takes a parameter of type `args ->
ComponentDef` (for some generic type `args`) and returns a function `args ->
ReactElement`. Under the hood, the `ComponentDef` is instantiated as a `React`
component with its own, internal message/update/transition loop, completely
independent of the parent component. The parent component may then use the `args
-> ReactElement` function in their `view` and not worry about routing the child
component's state and messages.

```haskell
module CollapsiblePanel where

render :: { title :: String, content :: ReactElement } -> ReactElement
render =
  wrapWithLocalState (ComponentName "CollapsiblePanel") \args ->
    { init, view: view args, update }

...

---------------------------------------------

module Parent where

import CollapsiblePanel as CP

type State = { ... } -- no mention of CP.State

data Message = ... -- no mention of CP.Message

view :: State -> Dispatch Message -> ReactElement
view state dispatch =
  ...
  , CP.render { title: "Panel 1", content: H.text "Content 1" }
  ...
  , CP.render { title: "Panel 2", content: H.text "Content 2" }
  ...

update :: State -> Message -> Transition Message State
update = ...  -- no mention of CP.update
```

In this example, the `args` type is `{ title :: String, content :: ReactElement
}`. We pass a function `args -> ComponentDef` to `wrapWithLocalState` and it
returns us a function `args -> ReactElement`, which we name `render` and then
use in the `Parent` module.

**NOTE 1**: the `ComponentName` parameter is unfortunately required due to how
React works under the hood. For a detailed explanation, see [docs on
Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-elmish/0.5.8/docs/Elmish.Component#t:ComponentName).
{: .callout }

**NOTE 2**: the name `wrapWithLocalState` will probably be changed in the
future. We do not like the name, but we were unable to come up with a better
alternative so far.
{: .callout }

This mode of composition works best under these conditions:

1. The "parent" component does not need access to state or messages of the "child" component.
2. The "child" component's state is trivial, not critical to the application.
   The underlying mechanism relies on React's component-local state (i.e. the
   `this.state` property), which turns out to be not guaranteed from occasional
   unwarranted reset.
